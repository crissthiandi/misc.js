## alt-title.js

Add the `title` attribute to `<img>` if the attribute does not exist. The value
of the attribute is taken from the `alt` attribute. It modifies

``` html
<img src="foo.png" alt="an image" />
```

to

``` html
<img src="foo.png" alt="an image" title="an image" />
```

Then the image will have a tooltip on mouseover.

## center-img.js

Center `<img>`, `<video>`, and `<object>` on a page if they are the only child
of their parent element.

## external-link.js

If a link of `<a>` does not start with `http://` or `https://`, add the
attribute `target="_blank"` to `<a>` so it opens in a new tab/window.

## faq.js

Turn an ordered list on an HTML page into a collapsible FAQ list. Click on any
question to toggle the visibility of its answer. Or click on the button at the
top-right to expand or collapse all answers. Each FAQ item has an anchor (shown
as the `#` symbol at the end on mouseover) that provides the link to the
specific question.

Note that you will need to load `faq.css` accordingly. See [a more detailed
introduction here](https://yihui.org/en/2021/10/faq-list/).

## fix-footnote.js

Fix links to/from footnotes rendered by lower versions of Hugo (Blackfriday)
when footnotes do not contain any ASCII characters, in which case Hugo is unable
to render unique `id`s for the footnote items (the `id` is `fn:-`).

## fix-toc.js

Fix the table of contents generated by lower versions of Hugo.

## header-link.js

Add anchor links to all section headers (e.g., `<h2>`) that have nonempty `id`
attributes.

## math-code.js

Write LaTeX math expressions (`$\alpha$`) in `<code></code` in HTML or a pair of
backticks in Markdown (which will be rendered to `<code>` in HTML), and this
script will remove the `<code>` tag, so that MathJax can recognize the math
expressions (by default, MathJax ignores math in `<code>`).

## no-highlight.js

Add the `nohighlight` class to `<code>` in `<pre>` when it does not have a
class, so that highlight.js will not try to syntax highlight the code in it.

## right-quote.js

Right-align a `<blockquote>` footer if the footer is a `<p>` that starts with
the em-dash.
